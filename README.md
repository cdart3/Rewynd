Idea: 

Timehop for content

Add relevant articles, inspiring quotes, funny videos, memorable podcasts moments, etc. and replay them based on a chronological filter

Examples:

1. Video- "Samesies"
   Note- Funny ass video
   Repeat- Once a month

2. Book- "Socrate's Cafe"
   Quote- "He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how." -Nietzsche
   Repeat- Once a week

As a web app, these will be sent as daily (possibly weekly to start) emails.
